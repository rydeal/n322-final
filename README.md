# N322 Final Project: Ryan Deal

## For my final project, I developed an app to help users keep track of their calorie intake.

With this app, a user is able to add, edit, and delete multiple users, with the ability to do the same thing with dates for proper documentation. Within each date, a user is then able to do the same for meals, and from there, items from the meal with calorie totals. At this point, the calories would be totaled up for each meal, and each meal's total calories would be totaled. From there, the user would then see if they are over, under, or meeting their calorie intake goal.
